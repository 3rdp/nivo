The aim of this project is to rewrite Nivo with hooks.
Not analyze all the lerna dependencies and refactor them.
Not eliminate lodash/get and other utils.
Not make sure that nivo bar/treemap work in the most optimal way,
    and there is no component tree hell like I've already seen.
There is some hooks. Make sure they're used everywhere.
There is HOCs. Make sure they're not used most of the time and
corresponding hooks are used instead.

List of core HOCs (incomplete):
    "core/src/hocs/withTheme.js"
    "core/src/hocs/withDimensions.js",
    "core/src/hocs/withContainer.js",
    "core/src/hocs/withCurve.js",
    "core/src/hocs/withHierarchy.js",
    "core/src/hocs/withMotion.js",

List of core hooks (incomplete):
useCurveInterpolation
useDimensions
usePartialTheme
useValueFormatter
